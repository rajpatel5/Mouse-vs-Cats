Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. 

	       Copy/paste the reported classification rates for:
	 	
	       Training data (last training round):

	       Testing data:


2 .- (1 marks) Repeat the process using the hyperbolic tangent activation
	       function.

		

3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
	       results? which one learned faster?
	
	The tanh function yielded a better result, however, the logistics function learned quicker. The 	logistics function averaged 35% classification rate in the first round while the hyperbolic tangent 		started with 70%, but tanh slightly outperformed the logistic function.


4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).	       
	       
	
5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

	
6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead
	

7 .- (3 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 

	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?

	As we reduce the number of hidden layers in an experiment, we are also reducing the accuracy of the 		classification. The network with 3 hidden layers tells us that the classification requires more 	features to be trained and a more granular representation of the character being recognized.


8 .- (3 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used:

	       Classification rate on testing data:


9 .- (3 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		- Describe the error function
		- How many layers should you use?

	Inputs: we would use the manhattan distance from the cheeses and cats. Also the number of walls 		around each cheese. 

	Outer Layer: There will be 5 neurons and each will encode the possible moves the mouse can make (up, down, right, left, and stay). 

	Error function: We will use tanh. 

	Number of Layers: 2 * (# cheeses) + (# cats) + 5
